    <p class="details ">My name is Sandra Chinouya. I was born in the beautyful country of Zimbabwe on the Estern side of the country
        <br />
    This side of the country is called the Estern Highlands or Manicaland, that is dominated by the Samanyika tribe.
    <br />
    I wasnt only born in this region but it was the home of my great grandparents and where my father grew up as well.
    <br />
    This is the place l call home and everything l know about my culture started in this area that is rich in every way.
    <br /> 
    Manicaland might be small but it is very rich in minerals and other natural resaurces, its a piece that fits right 
    <br />
    making Zimbabwe the beautyful country it is and I am proud to be part of this beautyful culture and legacy.
