<h4>
  FOOD
</h4>
<p>
  The cuisine of Zimbabwe is rooted in traditions of African cuisine but tempered by influences of having been a British colony. However, 
 maize and corn remain staple grains supplanted by millet, sorghum, rice, and wheat. A quintessential Zimbabwean dish is sadza paired with vegetables or meat. Mealie-meal is not just used to make food it is also used to make beverages like maheu. Naturally sour tasting, thick and creamy in consistency, maheu is sometimes sweetened with sugar. When fermented, it is an alcoholic beverage.Some taboos about food persist, while some have fallen out of favor. Eggs were thought to cause infertility in women and were to be avoided, a taboo less in practice these days. Those belonging to the Ndebele ethnicity avoid eating corn out of the season that it is harvested in. A lot of ethnic groups do not eat animals or plants that are on their family totem or that their family name is based/derived from.
